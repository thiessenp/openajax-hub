# openajax-hub

This project is about trying to make sure the work from the OpenAjax Aliance, mainly the Hub, is not lost. I really enjoy this early style of JavaScript programming, so it's also a study for me. The source files here were taken as is from the Source Forge project below. As a side note, the original project ended in 2006. The original authors were jferraiolo, jhpedemonte, jonferraiolo, jongund, peller. 

The last published version of the project was 2.0.7. Any future future version bumps are only about "wrapping" the project to work with existing frameworks.

The project page mainly points to itself (dead?) but for completeness it can be found here:
